## Development Guidelines

### Branch Strategy
- Create feature branches for each issue: `feature/admin-issue-N-description`
- Example: `feature/admin-issue-29-solidjs-setup`

### Tech Stack Specifications
- **Framework**: SolidJS + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + solid-ui components
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Location**: `/adminapp` folder
- **Deployment**: CloudFlare Pages

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for authentication and API calls
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Aim for >80% test coverage on critical paths

### API Integration
All admin features integrate with existing backend endpoints:
- `/auth/*` - Authentication
- `/restaurants/*` - Restaurant management
- `/menu/*` - Menu operations
- `/orders/*` - Order viewing
- `/qr/*` - QR code generation

### Key Dependencies Between Issues
```

Issue #31 (Restaurant Dashboard)
    ↓ ↙
Issue #32 (Tables/QR) ← Issue #33 (Menu Management)

Issue #34 (Order Management) ←┘
    ↓
Issue #35 (UI Polish)
    ↓
Issue #36 (Testing & Deployment)
```

## Total Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days (Foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days (Authentication)  
- **Phase 3**: 12-16 days (Core Features)
- **Phase 4**: 5-7 days (Polish & Production)

**Total: 20-28 days** (approximately 4-6 weeks)

## Notes
- Issues #32 and #33 can potentially be worked on in parallel after Issue #31
- Issue #36 (testing) should be worked on incrementally during development
- All features should integrate with the existing backend API
- Each issue should include proper error handling and loading states
- Responsive design considerations should be included from the beginning
